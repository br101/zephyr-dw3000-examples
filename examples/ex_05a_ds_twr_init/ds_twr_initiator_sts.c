 *  @brief   Double-sided two-way ranging (DS TWR) initiator example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example which acts as the initiator in a DS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application sends a "poll"
 *           frame (recording the TX time-stamp of the poll), after which it waits for a "response" message from the "ds_twr_responder_sts" example
 *           code (companion to this application) to complete the exchange.
 *
 *           This example utilises the 802.15.4z STS to accomplish secure timestamps between the initiator and responder. A 32-bit STS counter
 *           is part of the STS IV used to generate the scrambled timestamp sequence (STS) in the transmitted packet and to cross correlate in the
 *           receiver. This count normally advances by 1 for every 1024 chips (~2µs) of STS in BPRF mode, and by 1 for every 512 chips (~1µs) of STS
 *           in HPRF mode. If both devices (initiator and responder) have count values that are synced, then the communication between devices should
 *           result in secure timestamps which can be used to calculate distance. If not, then the devices need to re-sync their STS counter values.
 *           In this example, the initiator will send a plain-text value of it's 32-bit STS counter inside the "poll" frame. The receiver first
 *           checks the quality of the STS of the received frame. If the received frame has bad STS quality, it can then use the plain-text
 *           counter value received to adjust it's own STS counter value to match. This means that the next message in the sequence should be in sync again.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The double-sided two-way ranging scheme implemented here has to be considered carefully as the accuracy of the distance measured is highly
 *    sensitive to the clock offset error between the devices and the length of the response delay between frames. To achieve the best possible
 *    accuracy, this response delay must be kept as low as possible. In order to do so, 6.8 Mbps data rate is used in this example and the response
 *    delay between frames is defined as low as possible. The user is referred to User Manual for more details about the double-sided two-way ranging
 *    process.  NB:SEE ALSO NOTE 14.
 * 2. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, this should be experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded
 *    value (expected to be a little low so a positive error will be seen on the resultant distance estimate). For a real production application, each
 *    device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get good precision when performing range measurements.
 * 3. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
 *    following:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW IC.
 * 4. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 5. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete response frame sent by the responder at the
 *    6.8M data rate used (around 300 µs).
 * 6. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 7. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 9. The high order byte of each 40-bit time-stamps is discarded here. This is acceptable as, on each device, those time-stamps are not separated by
 *    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays can be handled by a 32-bit
 *    subtraction.
 * 10. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 11. The use of the clock offset value to correct the TOF calculation, significantly improves the result of the SS-TWR where the remote
 *     responder unit's clock is a number of PPM offset from the local initiator unit's clock.
 *     As stated in NOTE 2 a fixed offset in range will be seen unless the antenna delay is calibrated and set correctly.
 * 12. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 20 MHz can be used
 *     thereafter.
 * 13. This example uses the 802.15.4z STS with a packet configuration of mode 1 which looks like so:

 *     There is a possibility that the TX and RX units in this example will go out of sync as their STS IV values may be misaligned. The STS IV value
 *     changes upon each receiving and transmitting event by the chip. While the TX and RX devices in this example start at the same STS IV values, it
 *     is possible that they can go out sync if a signal is not received correctly, devices are out of range, etc. To combat this, the 'poll message'
 *     that the initiator sends to the responder contains a plain-text STS counter value. The responder receives this message and first checks if
 *     the received frame is out of sync with it's own counter. If so, it will use this received counter value to update it's own counter. When out
 *     of sync with each other, the STS will not align correctly - thus we get no secure timestamp values.
 * 14. The receiver is enabled with reference to the timestamp of the previously received signal.
 *     The receiver will start after a defined delay.
 *     This defined delay is currently the same as the delay between the responder's received
 *     timestamp of it's last received frame and the timestamp of the transmitted signal that is
 *     sent in response.
 *     This means that the initiator needs to reduce it's delay by the configured preamble length.
 *     This allows for the receiver to enable on the initiator at the same time as responder is
 *     transmitting it's message. It should look something like this:
 *
 *     Initiator: |Poll TX| ..... |Resp RX| ........ |Final TX|
 *     Responder: |Poll RX| ..... |Resp TX| ........ |Final RX|
 *                    ^|P RMARKER|                                    - time of Poll TX/RX
 *                                    ^|R RMARKER|                    - time of Resp TX/RX
 *                                                       ^|R RMARKER| - time of Final TX/RX

 * 15. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *     configuration.
 * 16. This example will set the STS key and IV upon each iteration of the main while loop. While this has the benefit of keeping the STS count in
 *     sync with the responder device (which does the same), it should be noted that this is not a 'secure' implementation as the count is reset upon
 *     each iteration of the loop. An attacker could potentially recognise this pattern if the signal was being monitored. While it serves it's
 *     purpose in this simple example, it should not be utilised in any final solution.
 * 17. Delays between frames have been chosen here to ensure proper synchronisation of transmission and reception of the frames between the initiator
 *     and the responder and to ensure a correct accuracy of the computed distance. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM Source Code Guide for more
 *     details about the timings involved in the ranging process.
 *
 *  EXAMPLE 1: with SPI rate set to 18 MHz (default on this platform), and frame lengths of ~190 us, the delays can be set to:
 *             POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS of 400uus, and RESP_RX_TO_FINAL_TX_DLY_UUS of 400uus (TXtoRX delays are set to 210uus)
 *             reducing the delays further can be achieved by using interrupt to handle the TX/RX events, or other code optimisations/faster SPI
 *
 *  EXAMPLE 2: with SPI rate set to 4.5 MHz, and frame lengths of ~190 us, the delays can be set to:
 *             POLL_RX_TO_RESP_TX_DLY_UUS of 550uus, and RESP_RX_TO_FINAL_TX_DLY_UUS of 600uus (TXtoRX delays are set to 360 and 410 uus respectively)
 *
 * 19. As we want to send final TX timestamp in the final message, we have to compute it in advance instead of relying on the reading of DW IC
 *     register. Timestamps and delayed transmission time are both expressed in device time units so we just have to add the desired response delay to
 *     response RX timestamp to get final transmission time. The delayed transmission time resolution is 512 device time units which means that the
 *     lower 9 bits of the obtained value must be zeroed. This also allows to encode the 40-bit value in a 32-bit words by shifting the all-zero lower
 *     8 bits.
