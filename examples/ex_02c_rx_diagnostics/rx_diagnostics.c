 *  @brief   Simple RX with diagnostics example code
 *
 *           This application waits for reception of a frame. After each frame received with a good CRC it reads some data provided by DW IC:
 *               - Diagnostics data (e.g. first path index, first path amplitude, channel impulse response, etc.). See dwt_rxdiag_t structure for more
 *                 details on the data read.
 *               - Accumulator values around the first path.
 *           It also reads event counters (e.g. CRC good, CRC error, PHY header error, etc.) after any event, be it a good frame or an RX error. See
 *           dwt_deviceentcnts_t structure for more details on the counters read.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4 UWB standard maximum frame length. DW IC supports an extended
 *    frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 2. Accumulator values are complex numbers: one 24-bit integer for real part and one 24-bit value for imaginary part, for each sample. In this
 *    example, we chose to read 3 values below the first path index and 3 values above. It must be noted that the first byte read when accessing the
 *    accumulator memory is always garbage and must be discarded, that is why the data length to read is increased by one byte here.
 * 3. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 20 MHz can be used
 *    thereafter.
 * 4. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW IC offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible, but RXFCG and error/timeout status events can be used to generate
 *    interrupts. Please refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 6. Here we chose to read only a few values around the first path index but it is possible and can be useful to get all accumulator values, using
 *    the relevant offset and length parameters. Reading the whole accumulator will require 4064 bytes of memory. First path value gotten from
 *    dwt_readdiagnostics is a 10.6 bits fixed point value calculated by the DW IC. By dividing this value by 64, we end up with the integer part of
 *    it. This value can be used to access the accumulator samples around the calculated first path index as it is done here.
 * 7. Event counters are never reset in this example but this can be done by re-enabling them (i.e. calling again dwt_configeventcounters with
 *    "enable" parameter set).
 * 8. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
