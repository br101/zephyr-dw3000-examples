 *  @brief   Sets data pending bit in ack message if correct criteria is met.
 *           The data pending bit will be set if the following criteria is met:
 *           1. The frame received is a MAC command frame.
 *           2. The address of the device sending the MAC command frame matches
 *           one of the four 16-bit addresses programmed into LE_PEND01 or
 *           LE_PEND23 registers and the data pending bits are set in FF_CFG
 *           register: LE0_PEND – LE3_PEND.
 *           3.The address of the device sending the MAC command is 16-bits and SSADRAPE bit is set.
 *           4.The address of the device sending the MAC command is 64-bits and LSADRAPE bit is set.
 *           5.Security bit is not set in Frame Control and frame version is 0 or 1.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. PAN ID and short address are hard coded constants to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the DW IC
 *    during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that customers
 *    buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items.
 * 2. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4z UWB standard maximum frame length. DW IC supports an extended frame
 *    length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 3. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 4. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW IC offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 5. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 6. This is the purpose of the AAT bit in DW IC's STATUS register but because of an issue with the operation of AAT, it is simpler to directly
 *    check in the frame control if the ACK request bit is set. Please refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on Auto ACK feature and the AAT
 *    bit.
 * 7. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 8. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *    configuration.
