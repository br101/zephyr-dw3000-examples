 *  @file    le_pend_tx.c
 *  @brief   Simple example that transmits mac message and wait for ack response from rx.
 *           This example is run in parallel with simple example LE PEND RX.
 *           The receiver will set the data pending bit in the ack frame if the follow criteria is met:
 *           1. The frame received is a MAC command frame.
 *           2. The address of the device sending the MAC command frame matches
 *           one of the four 16-bit addresses programmed into LE_PEND01 or
 *           LE_PEND23 registers and the data pending bits are set in FF_CFG
 *           register: LE0_PEND – LE3_PEND.
 *           3.The address of the device sending the MAC command is 16-bits and SSADRAPE bit is set.
 *           4.The address of the device sending the MAC command is 64-bits and LSADRAPE bit is set.
 *           5.Security bit is not set in Frame Control and frame version is 0 or 1
 *           Ack frame can then be check if data pending bit has been set correctly.

The frame below is an example of a MAC command frame encoded as per the IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard.
It is composed of the following fields:
    - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8863 to indicate a MAC command frame using 16-bit addressing and requesting ACK).
      - bits 0-2: Frame Type: 011 - MAC command frame
      - bit 3: Security Enabled: 0 - No security enabled
      - bit 4: Frame Pending: 0 - No additional data for recipient
      - bit 5: AR: 1 - ACK frame required from recipient device on receipt of data frame
      - bit 6: PAN ID Compression: 1 - PAN IDs are identical, Source PAN ID field shall be omitted from transmitted
        frame
      - bit 7: Reserved: 0
      - bit 8: Sequence Number Suppression: 0 - Sequence number field is present
      - bit 9: IE Present: 0 - No IEs contained in frame
      - bits 10-11: Destination Addressing Mode: 10 - Address field contains short address
      - bits 12-13: Frame Version: 00 - Using IEEE Std 802.15.4-2003 frames
      - bits 14-15: Source Addressing Mode: 10 - Include source address in frame
    - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
    - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA)
    - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 2 below.
    - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 2 below.
    - byte 9: Command ID field

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. This example can be turned into a high speed data transfer test by removing the delay executed between two successful transmissions. The
 *    communication configuration and MAC payload size in the message can be changed to see the effect of the different parameters on the throughput
 *    (which can be computed using the different counters provided in the application). For example using the debugger to stop at the start of the
 *    while loop, and then timing from the "GO" for a few minutes before breaking in again, and examining the frame counters.
 * 2. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the DW IC
 *    during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that customers
 *    buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW IC User Manual.
 * 3. In this example, receive buffer is set to the exact size of the only frame we want to handle but 802.15.4z UWB standard maximum frame length is
 *    127 bytes. DW IC also supports an extended frame length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example..
 * 4. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *     configuration.
 * 5. TX to RX delay is set to 0 to activate reception immediately after transmission, as the companion "LE PEND RX" example is configured to send
 *    the ACK immediately after reception of the frame sent by this example application.
 * 6. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 7. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
