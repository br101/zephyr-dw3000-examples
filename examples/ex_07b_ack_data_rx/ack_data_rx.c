 *  @brief   Automatically Acknowledged data RX example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example that turns on the DW IC receiver to receive a frame, (expecting the frame as sent by the companion simple
 *           example "ACK DATA TX"). The DW IC is configured so that when a correctly addressed data frame is received with the ACK request (AR) bit
 *           set in the frame control field, the DW IC will automatically respond with an ACK frame. The code loops after each frame reception to
 *           await another frame.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. PAN ID and short address are hard coded constants to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the DW IC
 *    during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that customers
 *    buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items.
 * 2. In this example, maximum frame length is set to 127 bytes which is 802.15.4z UWB standard maximum frame length. DW IC supports an extended frame
 *    length (up to 1023 bytes long) mode which is not used in this example.
 * 3. In this example, the DW IC is put into IDLE state after calling dwt_initialise(). This means that a fast SPI rate of up to 20 MHz can be used
 *     thereafter.
 * 4. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 5. Manual reception activation is performed here but DW IC offers several features that can be used to handle more complex scenarios or to
 *    optimise system's overall performance (e.g. timeout after a given time, automatic re-enabling of reception in case of errors, etc.).
 * 6. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 7. This is the purpose of the AAT bit in DW IC's STATUS register but because of an issue with the operation of AAT, it is simpler to directly
 *    check in the frame control if the ACK request bit is set. Please refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on Auto ACK feature and the AAT
 *    bit.
 * 8. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *    DW IC API Guide for more details on the DW IC driver functions.
 * 9. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *    configuration.
