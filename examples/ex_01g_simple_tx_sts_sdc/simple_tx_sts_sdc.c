/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The device ID is a hard coded constant in the blink to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the
 *    DW IC during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that
 *    customers buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW IC User Manual.
 * 2. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW IC OTP memory.
 * 3. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of tx_msg as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW IC. This means that our tx_msg could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 4. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but the TXFRS status event can be used to generate an interrupt.
 *    Please refer to DW IC User Manual for more details on "interrupts".
 * 5. This example code functions in the same manner as the simple_tx.c test code, however it uses the STS that was introduced in IEEE 802.15.4z
 * 6. Since this example is using the STS, it will be using one of the newer frame formats that were introduced in IEEE 802.15.4z.
 *    It will use packet configuration 2 which looks like so:
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *    | Ipatov Preamble | SFD | STS | PHR | PHY Payload |
 *    ---------------------------------------------------
 *    Since this example is for test purposes only and not meant to illustrate a working use case, we will be sending unencrypted data in the PHY
 *    Payload to the receiver device. This is obviously not recommended in a real use case as it is not a very secure format of data transmission.
 *    However, it is useful to illustrate how a transmitter and receiver will work with one and other at a basic level using the STS.
 *    Also the STS will be using deterministic code thus the receiver will stay in sync with transmitter even in case of missed frames/errored frames.
 *    There are more realistic examples in the code base that utilise STS, ranging and encrypted data payloads for a more complete solution.
 * 7. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
 *    following:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 0 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 4 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
 * 8. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants to keep the example simple but for a real product every device should have a unique ID.
 *    For development purposes it is possible to generate a DW IC unique ID by combining the Lot ID & Part Number values programmed into the DW IC
 *    during its manufacture. However there is no guarantee this will not conflict with someone else’s implementation. We recommended that customers
 *    buy a block of addresses from the IEEE Registration Authority for their production items. See "EUI" in the DW IC User Manual.
 * 9. Desired configuration by user may be different to the current programmed configuration. dwt_configure is called to set desired
 *    configuration.
